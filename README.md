# NextJS dashboard
This is a single page dashboard built with NextJS. You can view it [here](https://data-toolkit.vercel.app/)

## How it works
This web app fetches data from a server and displays to the user using chartJS. It follows these principles:
1. Fetch latest data during each render
2. Fetch only the data you need to display
3. Do heavy lifting on the server side

## Languages + Frameworks
* JavaScript
* NextJS
